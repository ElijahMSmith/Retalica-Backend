Currently: Reddit APi access works like a charm and everything that's written here is functional

What still needs to happen:
- HTTP connection to and from Flutter
- Performance improvements when checking against company names
- Expanded company list (include important stocks)
- Additional judging criterea, possible our own metric

- Also need to expand list of stocks. Currently doing some mass text editing for that.

My ideas of more efficient topStocks:
    - Include more stocks, but in a sorted array (can pre-sort before putting in file)
    - Binary search for each word of title and check if it is in any of company names
        - How much of the company do we include? Just one word?
            - Current approach looking for company in title doesn't have this problem,
              but requires looking through every company 500 times, which isn't scalable
